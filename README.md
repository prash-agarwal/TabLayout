# TabLayout in Android Development Using Java.

TabLayout helps to display multiple UI in a single Activity by using Fragments.
In this project I have implemented TabLayout consisting of 3 different colored Fragments comprising of 3 Tabs Namely (Chats, Status, Calls ).
TabLayout is designed with the help of ViewPager which gives a sliding effect in moving from one tab to another.
